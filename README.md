# DiffDock
## Colab version of DiffDock

Please refer [Research Article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01776) for Implementation of DiffDock, state-of-the-art method for molecular docking, by Gabriele Corso*, Hannes Stark*. Please refer [Github](https://github.com/gcorso/DiffDock) for DiffDock implmentation code.

1.   This notebook allows you to run diffdock on single protein/ligands and also multiple proteins/ligands.

2.   Colab basic version works fine with single simulations. "Premium GPU" (colab pro), and even then it may fail on large complexes.
